A small and simple CLI for `jitsi-meet` written in [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
> Used node version: v10.15.3 

Jitsi is a set of open-source projects that allows you to easily build and deploy secure videoconferencing solutions. This CLI is for the great Jitsi Meet video conferencing platform, meet.jit.si where the jitsi.org hosts a Jitsi Meet instance that the community can use for totally free video conferences , and the Jitsi Videobridge that powers all of the multi-party video capabilities.
    

> **INFO**:   
> `jtisi-cli` is still under development and by far not perfect. Feel free to contribute.  
> See [General Informations](##General-Informations) for more about this tool

## General Informations

I started to develop this CLI-Tool because I really love jitsi and use it a lot in my daily life. Since I mainly work with the terminal, I found it useful to start a jitsi-meet session quickly with one command. Feel free to add more useful things to this tool (e.g. more name generators).
